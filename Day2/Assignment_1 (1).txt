Answers:
1.How does the generate_prompt function work, and what categories of prompts does it support?
 The generate_prompt() function is typically used in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, fine-tuning scripts, or prompt-engineering pipelines to dynamically build model input text.
 It formats input data (context, instruction, user input, etc.) into a structured text prompt that can be sent to an LLM (Large Language Model).
 It acts as a template builder — it ensures the model always receives prompts in a consistent and effective format, depending on the category or task type. 
 Categories of Prompts It Usually Supports:
 i)Instruction-For instruction-tuned models (e.g., “Do X”)->"Instruction: Explain quantum computing in simple terms.\nAnswer:"
ii)Question-Answer (QA)-Direct Q&A interactions-"Question: What causes rain?\nAnswer:"
iii)Summarization-Summarize long texts-"Summarize the following article:\n{article_text}\nSummary:"
iv)Classification-Categorize text or detect sentiment-"Classify this text as Positive, Neutral, or Negative:\n{text}"
v)Dialogue / Chat-Conversational context-"User: {input}\nAssistant:"
vi)RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)-Combine retrieved document context with user query-"Context: {retrieved_docs}\n\nQuestion: {user_query}\nAnswer:"
vii)Translation-Translate between languages-"Translate this text to French:\n{text}\nTranslation:"
viii)Code Generation-Generate or explain code snippets-"Write a Python function to reverse a string.\nCode:"

2.Can you provide an example of a prompt generated for the "completion" category?
    generate_prompt() function supports a "completion" category, it’s typically designed for open-ended text generation — where the model continues or completes a given piece of text, story, or sentence.
    def generate_prompt(category, input_text):
    if category == "completion":
        return f"Continue the following text:\n\n{input_text}\n\nCompletion:"
    
    Example Input:
    prompt = generate_prompt(
    category="completion",
    input_text="The future of artificial intelligence lies in"
        )
    print(prompt)
    Model output:
    developing systems that can reason ethically, adapt to human values, and collaborate seamlessly across disciplines.”

3.Discuss the significance of well-crafted prompts in prompt engineering.
A well-crafted prompt transforms an LLM from a general text generator into a domain-specific expert assistant.
It is the one that guides the model precisely, reduces ambiguity, and maximizes output quality — much like asking a human expert the right question in the right way.
Significance of Well-Crafted Prompts:
1.Improves Accuracy and Relevance:
Poorly phrased prompts lead to vague or irrelevant answers.
A well-designed prompt:
Defines the role (“You are a financial analyst…”)
Sets context (“Analyze the following stock performance data…”)
Clarifies task (“Summarize key trends in 3 bullet points.”)
Result: The model focuses on your intent instead of guessing it.
2.Controls Tone, Style, and Format
Prompts can shape how a model communicates:
Formal vs. casual tone
Short vs. detailed answers
Specific output format (e.g., JSON, Markdown, bullet points)
Example:
“Explain photosynthesis in simple terms for a 10-year-old in 3 short sentences.”
This ensures structured, audience-appropriate responses.
3. Enhances Consistency in Applications
In production systems (like chatbots, RAG, or AI assistants), consistent prompts ensure:
Predictable responses
Easier evaluation and debugging
Stable performance across queries
Developers often use prompt templates (like your generate_prompt() function) to enforce this uniformity.
4.Extracts Complex Reasoning from Models
LLMs are sensitive to how problems are framed.
Prompts like:
“Let’s reason step by step.”
or
“Explain your reasoning before giving the final answer.”
help trigger chain-of-thought-like reasoning — improving logic, math, and problem-solving accuracy.
5. Bridges Human Intent and Model Behavior
Prompts act as the “interface” between human goals and model capabilities.
A well-engineered prompt:
Translates vague intent (“Help me plan a trip”)into clear model instructions (“Create a 5-day itinerary for Rome with historical sites and local cuisine.”)
Without this bridge, even advanced models may misinterpret intent.
6. Reduces the Need for Fine-Tuning
In many cases, prompt tuning can outperform or complement model fine-tuning, saving compute and cost.
