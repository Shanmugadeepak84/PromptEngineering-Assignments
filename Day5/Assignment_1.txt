1.	GitHub Copilot Exploration:
o	Scenario: You’re working on a Python project that involves data analysis. You need to write a function that calculates the average of a list of numbers.
o	Task: Use GitHub Copilot to generate the Python function that computes the average of a given list.

Answer:
Step 1: Open Your Python File

Open a file in VS Code or your IDE (e.g., average.py).

Step 2: Write a Clear Prompt as a Comment

Copilot responds to comments as prompts.

Type:

# Write a Python function that calculates the average of a list of numbers

Step 3: Wait for Copilot’s Suggestion

Copilot will automatically suggest a code snippet below the comment (in gray text).
If it doesn’t, press Ctrl + Enter (Windows) to manually trigger the suggestion.

Expected GitHub Copilot Output

Copilot will likely generate something like this:

def calculate_average(numbers):
    if not numbers:
        return 0
    return sum(numbers) / len(numbers)
